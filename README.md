# Project Library

Project Library is a project from The Odin Project aimed at practicing Objects and Object constructors as a design pattern.


## Status

Everything "works" but some issues need to be fixed.


## Issues

- Form validations isn't working properly. E.g: pages input shouldn't allow you to enter a non number type.
- Validation messages need a better delivery method than 'alert'.
