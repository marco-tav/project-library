# Project Library

Project Library is a project from The Odin Project aimed at practicing Objects and Object constructors as a design pattern.


## Status

Everything "works" but some issues need to be fixed.


## Issues

- A function that updates the data-index properties of book-cards of index greater than a removed card to reduce it's value by one, so it matches actual book index.
- Form validation needs a ton of work.
- Form validation message needs a better way of displaying than alert.
